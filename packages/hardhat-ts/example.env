# This is a template for the environment variables you'll need for 
# deployment on Rinkeby and mainnet

# To use, copy this file, rename it .env, and fill in the values
# Everything will be interpreted as a string by JavaScript even though 
# you should not wrap values in quotation marks

# Infura endpoints should be passed in WITHOUT the rest of the url
# Private keys should be pasted WITHOUT the 0x prefix
